refactor(orchestrator): Integrate Bayesian engine for Axis 2

Replaces the previous black-box ML model call for the molecular
profile (Axis 2) with the new glass-box BayesianEngine.

The orchestrator now:
- Initializes the BayesianEngine with the knowledge base.
- Calls the `run_inference_with_uncertainty` method.
- Formats the probabilistic output (mean posterior and credibility
  interval) into the final patient report.

This commit marks the first successful end-to-end integration of the
new evidence-based reasoning core into the main application workflow.
