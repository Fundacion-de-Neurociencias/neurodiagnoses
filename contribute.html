# 🧠 Contributing to Neurodiagnoses

Welcome to the Neurodiagnoses project! We're building an open-source AI-powered diagnostic framework for CNS diseases, integrating neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers, probabilistic reasoning, and clinical data. To collaborate effectively and maintain quality, please follow the guidelines below.

---

## 📁 Project Structure Overview

- `/notebooks`: For EDA, prototyping, and documentation.
- `/src`: Modular Python scripts for pipelines, models, data integration.
- `/data`: Preprocessed data, biomarker ontologies.
- `/docs`: Additional technical references and best practices.

## 📒 When to Use Notebooks

Notebooks are ideal for:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – First-pass analysis of imaging, CSF, genetic data.
- **Model Prototyping** – Quick iterations with `sklearn`, `xgboost`, etc.
- **Visual Reports** – Stakeholder-friendly summaries with charts and explanations.
- **Knowledge Sharing** – Annotated methods with narrative flow for internal or public sharing.

📌 Save them under `/notebooks`. Clear outputs before committing!

## 🧱 When to Use Scripts and Modular Code

Use scripts when:

- You need **reusability**, **reproducibility**, or **integration** with larger workflows.
- You're training final models to be logged/tracked in `MLflow` or `WandB`.
- You implement complex preprocessing or inference pipelines (e.g. MRI volumetry + CSF model fusion).
- You deploy tools or inference APIs (e.g. `FastAPI` or `Gradio` apps).

📌 Organize under `/src/` and follow the structure:

```
/src
  ├── data/
  ├── features/
  ├── models/
  ├── pipelines/
  └── utils/
```

---

## 🔄 Hybrid Workflow

Notebooks can call modular functions in `/src/` to display outputs visually, while final model training and automation should always be in script form.
