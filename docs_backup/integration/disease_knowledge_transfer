# **Integration Guidelines for Neurodiagnoses**

## **Overview**
This document outlines the integration strategy for incorporating **Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT)** methodologies into **Neurodiagnoses**. The goal is to leverage **transfer learning, multimodal biomarker analysis, and disease progression modeling** to improve neurodiagnostic accuracy.

## **Breakdown of Most Applicable Components for Neurodiagnoses**

### **1. Disease Progression Modeling**
- Uses generative models to estimate biomarker trajectories across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.
- Enables prediction of missing biomarker modalities based on related disease data.
- Facilitates modeling disease progression stages using MRI, PET, DTI, and genetic data.

### **2. Transfer Learning in Neurodiagnostics**
- Transfers biomarker knowledge from well-characterized diseases (e.g., AD) to rare neurodegenerative disorders.
- Trains on large datasets and applies learned insights to smaller, unimodal datasets.
- Infers missing biomarker trajectories for conditions with limited available data (e.g., Posterior Cortical Atrophy).

### **3. Explainability and Interpretability**
- Utilizes **disease-agnostic units** to maintain cross-disease biomarker relationships.
- Ensures adaptability to different neuroanatomical progression patterns.
- Supports visualization of predicted disease evolution, aiding clinical usability.

### **4. Multimodal Data Fusion**
- Integrates neuroimaging modalities (MRI, PET, DTI) and genetic data for comprehensive disease modeling.
- Provides a standardized approach for handling heterogeneous datasets.

### **5. Validation and Robustness**
- Uses synthetic data generation and real-world datasets (e.g., TADPOLE, PCA datasets) for validation.
- Adaptable to new datasets and biomarker types.

## **Integration Methods**

### **1. Direct Integration**
- Clone the **DKT** repository and extract the necessary models.
- Adapt the models to support **Neurodiagnoses-specific biomarkers**.
- Optimize the framework for **neuroimaging and genetic datasets**.

### **2. Submodule Approach**
- If the external project evolves separately, add it as a **Git submodule**.
- Maintain an **upstream link** while making project-specific modifications.

### **3. API-Based Integration**
- Deploy the external project as an independent service and interact via **API calls**.
- Useful for accessing pretrained **disease classification models, neuroimaging segmentation tools, and biomarker prediction pipelines**.

## **Implementation Strategy for Neurodiagnoses**

### **Step 1: Identify Key Algorithms & Methods**
- Extract core generative models for **disease progression estimation**.
- Focus on **biomarker trajectory estimation and multimodal integration**.
- Analyze the **transfer learning approach** for small-dataset disease modeling.

### **Step 2: Adapt to Neurodiagnoses**
- Modify models to support **Neurodiagnoses-specific biomarker datasets**.
- Ensure compatibility with **multi-modal neuroimaging pipelines**.
- Optimize **transfer learning techniques** for improved disease prediction.

### **Step 3: Document and Implement**
- Maintain clear documentation of **integrated methodologies**.
- Validate integration by comparing **inferred vs. known biomarker trajectories**.
- Provide clinical validation pathways to enhance **model credibility**.
