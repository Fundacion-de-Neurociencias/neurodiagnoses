# **Documentation: Probabilistic Logic and Tridimensional Annotation Implications from AD Co-Pathology Research**

## **Purpose**
This document clarifies how findings from recent Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology studies, particularly those focusing on **co-pathologies** and **regional tau burden heterogeneity**, align with and inform the logic behind **Neurodiagnoses’ probabilistic engine** and **tridimensional diagnostic annotation system**.

## **1. Tridimensional Diagnostic Annotation — Compatibility**

### **Key Principle**
The tridimensional system in Neurodiagnoses is **agnostic to inference logic** and functions strictly as a **final outcome annotation framework**.

### **Implication**
- Findings from the 2024 Nature Aging preprint (*Pathologic subtyping of AD brain tissue reveals disease heterogeneity*) are **directly compatible**.
- New dimensions such as:
  - **Regional tau gradients (hippocampal-sparing vs. predominant)**
  - **Presence of Lewy body or small vessel co-pathology**
  - **Anatomical asymmetry**
  - **Ethnicity-linked burden differences**
  can be **added as features in annotation**, without modifying the logic of the axes:

| Axis              | Enhanced By                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Etiology          | Genetic/demographic background (e.g. APOE4, ancestry) |
| Pathophysiology   | Tau gradient, LBD presence, vascular burden       |
| Anatomoclinical   | Asymmetry, regional atrophy, metabolic topology   |

## **2. Probabilistic Engine — Modeling Co-Pathologies**

### **Key Insight**
Co-pathologies are **not mutually exclusive** and may contribute to the observed clinical phenotype simultaneously. This implies that the **total sum of diagnostic probabilities** may:

#### Option A: **Exceed 100% (Independent Multi-Label Probabilities)**
- Each pathology (e.g. AD, LBD, TDP-43, SVD) is modeled **independently**.
- Suitable when goal is to **detect presence or absence** of multiple mechanisms:
  ```
  AD: 70%
  LBD: 50%
  SVD: 25%
  TDP-43: 10%
  ```
- Interpretation: Co-pathologies may coexist; total may exceed 100%.

#### Option B: **Sum to 100% (Composite or Exclusive Modeling)**
- Define **composite diagnostic classes** (e.g. “AD+LBD”, “Pure AD”, “AD+SVD”).
- Suitable for **primary diagnosis assignment** or ranking:
  ```
  AD+LBD: 45%
  Pure AD: 30%
  AD+SVD: 20%
  Other: 5%
  ```

### **Implementation Recommendation**
- Neurodiagnoses will support **both logic modes**:
  - Independent multi-label outputs (summation >100%).
  - Composite class output (sum = 100%).
- Selection will depend on use case (research, differential diagnosis, trial screening).

---

## **3. Summary**
- The recent pathology-based AD subtype models are **aligned with Neurodiagnoses’ existing logic**.
- Tridimensional annotation is unaffected and can incorporate new layers.
- Probabilistic outputs can either reflect **independent contributions** or **composite class estimates**.

This flexibility will support more accurate representation of **mixed, atypical, and ethnically diverse presentations** of neurodegeneration in the platform.
