# Plexe Integration Flow in Neurodiagnoses

**Date:** 2025-04-18

## Purpose

This document outlines the proposed workflow for integrating **Plexe** as an auxiliary tool to automatically generate clinical prediction models in the context of the **Neurodiagnoses** project, orchestrated by **ArqSysAI**.

---

## Use Case

> Predict Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on:
> `age`, `MMSE`, `p-Tau`, `hippocampal volume`

---

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Model Request (Supervisor Agent)

The supervisor agent within ArqSysAI identifies a need for a new model:

```bash
TASK: Generate a predictive model for MCI based on clinical and imaging variables.
INPUT: age, MMSE, p-Tau, hippocampal volume
OUTPUT: Exploratory model + basic performance evaluation
```

---

### 2. Automated Generation (MCP Agent via Plexe)

The MCP agent calls Plexe with a natural language specification:

```bash
plexe generate-model \
  --task "Classify Mild Cognitive Impairment" \
  --features "age, MMSE, p-Tau, hippocampal volume" \
  --target "clinical diagnosis (MCI)" \
  --type "binary classification" \
  --output "./prototypes/model_mci_plexe_v1/"
```

**Expected Output:**
- Python code for model training
- Cross-validation metrics
- Performance metrics (AUC, F1-score, precision, recall)
- Annotated notebook with charts and insights

---

### 3. Technical Validation and Documentation

- Model code is reviewed by an MCP agent or a human contributor
- Key information is documented in `prototypes/model_mci_plexe_v1/README.md`:
  - Rationale
  - Input features
  - Results
  - Limitations

---

### 4. Registry and Version Control

- Model is saved and flagged as **experimental**
- Registered in `models_registry.json`
- Optionally compared to other models for performance benchmarking

---

## Strategic Advantages

- Accelerates hypothesis testing with no need for extensive coding
- Enables collaboration with non-technical stakeholders (clinicians, psychologists, partners)
- Encourages agile prototyping and iterative refinement of auxiliary models

---

## Compliance and Risk Considerations

- Plexe is **not a regulated tool**: models must not be used in clinical decision-making without validation
- All generated code must be **audited and reviewed** prior to integration in production pipelines
- Suitable for **sandbox, R&D, or MVP generation workflows**

---

## Recommendation

Integrate Plexe as a callable module by MCP agents under the ArqSysAI architecture.

Use it to:
- Generate exploratory models when new data becomes available
- Test clinical hypotheses from collaborators
- Create candidate pipelines for downstream evaluation and approval

---

### Next Steps

- Implement script: `scripts/integrations/plexe_autogen.py`
- Create reference doc: `docs/flows/plexe_integration.md`
- Validate first model generation cycle using Plexe CLI or API
