Integrating the Neurodegenerative Disease Knowledge Portal (NDKP) into Neurodiagnoses
Phase 1: Infrastructure & Data Pipeline Setup
(1.1) Establish API/Data Access for NDKP

Identify NDKP’s available data access methods (e.g., API endpoints, bulk downloads, database integration).
If NDKP has an API, implement API-based queries for:
Variant-based queries (check PheWAS & association statistics for patient variants).
Gene-based queries (retrieve gene-level associations and pathway enrichment).
Phenotype-based queries (list all significant genetic hits for a specific disease or trait).
If using bulk downloads:
Automate periodic data ingestion scripts to fetch and preprocess new association statistics.
Store this in a structured database that Neurodiagnoses can access in real-time.
(1.2) Data Storage & Standardization

Convert NDKP association datasets into a structured database that aligns with Neurodiagnoses.
Ensure harmonization of genomic coordinates (GRCh37 vs GRCh38).
Store top genes, credible variant sets, pathways, and polygenic risk scores for major neurodegenerative diseases.
(1.3) Implement Query Processing System

Develop a variant-to-disease lookup table: Given a patient's variant list, return relevant diseases & evidence scores.
Implement cross-phenotype mapping: If a patient has a gene mutation linked to multiple diseases, list all relevant conditions.
Set up an internal scoring system to weight genetic variants based on NDKP evidence.
Phase 2: Feature Integration into Neurodiagnoses
(2.1) Probabilistic Annotation with NDKP Data

Modify Neurodiagnoses’ probabilistic engine to factor in:
NDKP HuGE scores (gene-disease evidence levels).
PheWAS results (associations between a variant and multiple diseases).
Pathway enrichment (if a patient has mutations in multiple genes from a pathway, adjust disease probability).
(2.2) Tridimensional Analysis & Imaging Integration

Develop an internal module that links MRI-based findings to genetic risk.
If a brain region shows atrophy, automatically check for NDKP-listed genetic variants associated with that region.
Implement genetic correlation filtering: If a patient has a neurodegenerative diagnosis but genetic evidence suggests another disease, recommend additional testing.
(2.3) Biomarker Prediction Model

Extend Neurodiagnoses’ ML models to include:
NDKP’s top biomarker genes per disease.
Rare variant burden analysis (NDKP already performs this for sequencing datasets).
Pathway-level biomarker analysis (group patients by pathway involvement rather than single mutations).
Create biomarker prioritization models: Weight predicted biomarkers based on:
Number of times they appear in NDKP datasets.
Genetic correlation strength with known disease markers.
(2.4) Disease Progression Modeling

Utilize NDKP’s polygenic risk score data for disease progression estimation.
Apply NDKP cross-disease data to suggest alternative disease trajectories (e.g., some ALS patients develop FTD-like symptoms).
Implement genetic subtyping: Use clustering methods to group patients based on genetic profiles.
Phase 3: Web & GitHub Integration
(3.1) GitHub Project Structure

Create a GitHub repository module named neurodiagnoses-genomics.
Add sections for:
API Integration: Scripts for querying NDKP.
Data Processing Pipelines: Scripts to clean, normalize, and store NDKP data.
ML Models: Scripts using NDKP data for probabilistic annotation, biomarker prediction, and disease progression.
(3.2) Web Platform Implementation

Update Neurodiagnoses’ UI to include:
A genetic report page that fetches NDKP-based associations.
A "Related Conditions" feature (if the patient has a genetic risk for multiple diseases, suggest differential diagnoses).
A “Polygenic Risk Score Calculator” (if the user provides their genome, compute their PRS using NDKP data).
Interactive visualizations for biomarker-pathway links.
(3.3) eBrains Collaboration & Data Federation

Implement data exchange workflows:
Store Neurodiagnoses’ patient variant data in eBrains-compatible formats.
Allow researchers to pull NDKP-based insights into Neurodiagnoses for personalized disease modeling.
Enable cross-referencing between Neurodiagnoses’ biomarker models and eBrains’ clinical datasets.
Phase 4: Validation & Deployment
(4.1) Benchmarking & Model Evaluation

Compare Neurodiagnoses’ predictions vs. NDKP-based risk predictions.
Validate new biomarkers discovered using Neurodiagnoses + NDKP against external datasets (UK Biobank, ADNI, etc.).
Run clinical feasibility studies: Test if NDKP-enhanced Neurodiagnoses models improve diagnosis accuracy.
(4.2) Long-Term Automation & Data Updates

Automate NDKP data refresh cycles (weekly/monthly updates).
Establish continuous model training pipelines to adjust probabilistic models as new genetic discoveries emerge.
Develop an audit system to track which NDKP variants have changed status (e.g., newly discovered ALS-linked SNPs).
Expected Impact
✅ More accurate genetic-based probabilistic diagnoses
✅ Improved biomarker prediction models with cross-validated genetic markers
✅ Integration of imaging and genetic risk factors for holistic neurodiagnostic modeling
✅ Better disease progression tracking using genetic risk scores
✅ Enhanced research capabilities by linking Neurodiagnoses with a global genetics database

This plan ensures that Neurodiagnoses fully leverages NDKP to advance AI-powered neurodiagnostics, providing a robust, research-backed, and clinically relevant platform.
