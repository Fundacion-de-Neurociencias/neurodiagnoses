# **Integration Plan: PandasAI in Neurodiagnoses (Concept Stage)**

## **1️⃣ Overview**
This document outlines the planned integration of **PandasAI** into **Neurodiagnoses** to enhance **data querying, automation, and interpretation** using natural language processing (NLP) and AI-powered analysis. **This feature has not been implemented yet** but serves as a conceptual framework for future development.

## **2️⃣ Objectives**
✅ Enable **natural language querying** for multimodal neurodata (MRI, EEG, biomarkers, clinical records).  
✅ Automate **data preprocessing, feature selection, and exploratory analysis**.  
✅ Improve **probabilistic diagnosis modeling** by leveraging AI-driven insights.  
✅ Enhance **3D diagnostic annotation** by dynamically querying neuroimaging data.  

---

## **3️⃣ Planned Implementation Roadmap**

### **Step 1: Install & Configure PandasAI in Neurodiagnoses**
1. **Install PandasAI** in the Neurodiagnoses environment:
   ```bash
   pip install pandasai
   ```
2. **Integrate with existing Pandas-based datasets**:
   ```python
   from pandasai import PandasAI
   from pandasai.llm.openai import OpenAI
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv("neurodiagnoses_data.csv")
   llm = OpenAI(api_key="your_openai_api_key")
   pandas_ai = PandasAI(llm)

   response = pandas_ai.run(df, prompt="Find patients with hippocampal atrophy and high tau levels")
   print(response)
   ```

### **Step 2: Train PandasAI for Neurodiagnostic Queries**
✅ **Fine-tune PandasAI** with domain-specific medical and neurodiagnostic terms.  
✅ **Map structured (MRI, biomarkers) & unstructured (clinical notes) data** for AI-assisted querying.  
✅ **Integrate Hugging Face models** for better **clinical NLP interpretation**.  

### **Step 3: Automate Data Processing & Preprocessing**
✅ **Pre-clean & format neuroimaging & biomarker data**:
   ```python
   pandas_ai.run(df, prompt="Standardize all MRI reports for AI training")
   ```
✅ **Detect missing data & anomalies**:
   ```python
   pandas_ai.run(df, prompt="List patients missing EEG data but with complete MRI scans")
   ```

### **Step 4: Enhance Probabilistic Diagnosis & 3D Annotation**
✅ **Use tensor-based dMRI analysis** to refine **anatomoclinical annotations**:
   ```python
   pandas_ai.run(df, prompt="Which brain regions show tensor anomalies in diffusion MRI?")
   ```
✅ **Generate AI-powered clinical summaries** for patient diagnostics.

### **Step 5: Develop a User-Friendly Clinical Dashboard**
✅ **Enable speech-to-text queries** for clinicians interacting with **probabilistic models**.  
✅ **Deploy PandasAI-powered dashboards** where users can input natural language queries.  
✅ **Integrate into Neurodiagnoses’ backend to enhance query response time**.

## **4️⃣ Expected Outcomes**
🚀 **Faster and more accessible data exploration** for researchers and clinicians.  
🚀 **Automated feature extraction and preprocessing** for neuroimaging and biomarkers.  
🚀 **Improved probabilistic diagnosis modeling** with AI-augmented queries.  
🚀 **Real-time 3D diagnostic annotation based on user queries**.

## **5️⃣ Status: Not Implemented Yet**
🔲 **This integration is currently in the conceptual phase and has not been implemented yet.**  
🔲 **Development requires further validation of PandasAI’s performance with neurodiagnostic datasets.**  
🔲 **The framework will be refined based on feasibility studies and early testing.**  

---

### **Next Steps**
🔲 **Develop a prototype API integrating PandasAI in Neurodiagnoses workflows**.  
🔲 **Test NLP query accuracy on real-world neuroimaging datasets (ADNI, EBRAINS)**.  
🔲 **Deploy PandasAI-driven clinical dashboard for real-time neurodiagnostic querying**.

✅ **This integration will transform how researchers and clinicians interact with Neurodiagnoses, making AI-powered neurodata analysis more intuitive and efficient.**
