# **Proposal for Integration of MCP Servers in Neurodiagnoses.com**

## **1. Objective**

To explore and document the integration of **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** into the **Neurodiagnoses.com** ecosystem to enhance biomedical information retrieval, code execution, semantic memory construction, and the development of clinical AI agents.

---

## **2. Priority MCP Servers and Proposed Applications**

### **2.1. Qdrant MCP Server**

**Objective:** Build a **semantic vector memory** to enable intelligent search within the Neurodiagnoses ecosystem.

**Applications:**

- Construct a vector database using embeddings of scientific articles, protocols, clinical reports, and guidelines.
- Develop AI agents for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- Semantic search within the projectâ€™s documentation repositories (EBRAINS, GitHub, clinical references).

**Technical Integration:**

- Use `sentence-transformers` and `langchain` to generate embeddings.
- Integrate with `PandasAI` and LLMs for clinical query handling over vector databases.

### **2.2. Firecrawl MCP Server**

**Objective:** Automate the extraction and structuring of information from **complex biomedical websites**.

**Applications:**

- Automated content curation from sources like ADVP, GeneCards, NIAGADS, PubMed.
- Convert HTML-based documentation (FAQs, publications, APIs) into clean, structured text for NLP and RAG use.

**Technical Integration:**

- Integrate as a preprocessing step for external biomedical data sources.
- Use in conjunction with conversational agents or scheduled tasks.

---

### **2.3. E2B MCP Server**

**Objective:** Enable safe execution of Python/JavaScript code in a sandboxed environment.

**Applications:**

- Prototyping ML notebooks, biomarker analysis, neuroimaging pipelines.
- Remote execution of scripts via conversational agents within Neurodiagnoses.

**Technical Integration:**

- Use with Smithery or from a Jupyter-based interface (available via EBRAINS).
- Integrate with existing workflows for model training and data visualization.

---

## **3. Expected Benefits**

- Enhanced experience for non-technical users through intelligent agents.
- Automated biomedical source curation without direct API access.
- Secure remote execution of scientific code in isolated environments.
- Progressive implementation of an AI agent ecosystem capable of reading, reasoning, retrieving, and executing tasks within Neurodiagnoses.
