        <h1>What is Neurodiagnoses?</h1>
        <p>Neurodiagnoses is an AI-powered diagnostic framework that integrates multi-modal data, including genetics, biomarkers, and neuroimaging, to improve the accuracy of CNS disease diagnosis.</p>
        <p>This project was started on the 1st February 2025, therefore it is in its initial steps.</p>
        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔹 Develop an **AI-driven annotation system** to assist in CNS disease diagnosis.</li>
            <li>🔹 Integrate **genetic, neuroimaging, and biomarker data** into a unified framework.</li>
            <li>🔹 Implement a **tridimensional classification system** based on etiology, pathology markers, and clinical symptoms.</li>
            <li>🔹 Use **machine learning models** to enhance diagnostic precision and stratification of patients.</li>
            <li>🔹 Collaborate with **EBRAINS** to leverage high-performance computing and data storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is This Important?</h2>
        <p>Traditional CNS disease classification relies on phenotypic observations, leading to misdiagnoses and overlapping syndromes. Neurodiagnoses shifts the paradigm to a **data-driven approach**, providing more reliable, precise, and scalable diagnostic solutions.</p>

        <h2>Key Components of the Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🧠 **AI-Powered Annotation System** – Automates structured reporting based on biomarkers and neuroimaging data.</li>
            <li>📊 **EBRAINS Integration** – Stores and processes datasets for federated AI training.</li>
            <li>🔬 **Machine Learning Models** – Enhances predictive capabilities for disease progression.</li>
            <li>⚕️ **Clinical Decision Support** – Helps clinicians interpret diagnostic outputs with confidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>We welcome contributions from researchers, AI specialists, and clinicians. <a href="contribute.html">Join us</a> in redefining CNS diagnostics!</p>
