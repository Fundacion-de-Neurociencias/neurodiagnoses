# What is Neurodiagnoses?  

Neurodiagnoses is an **AI-powered open-source diagnostic framework** designed to improve the accuracy of **complex central nervous system (CNS) disease diagnosis**.  

The project **integrates multi-modal data** (genetics, biomarkers, neuroimaging) with **machine learning models** to provide clinicians with a **dual diagnostic system**:  

### **1️⃣ Probabilistic Diagnosis**  
- AI assigns **multiple possible diagnoses** with probability percentages.  

### **2️⃣ Tridimensional Diagnosis**  
- AI structures diagnoses based on:  
  - **Etiology** (genetic, metabolic, autoimmune, vascular, infectious)  
  - **Molecular Biomarkers** (CSF, PET, EEG, MRI markers)  
  - **Neuroanatomoclinical Correlations** (functional impairments, atrophy)  

📌 **For every patient case, both systems will be provided**, allowing AI-assisted comparison of probability-based vs. structured classification.

## **🎯 Project Objectives**  

✔ Develop an **AI-driven annotation system** to assist in CNS disease diagnosis.  
✔ Integrate **genetic, neuroimaging, and biomarker data** into a unified framework.  
✔ Implement a **tridimensional classification system** based on etiology, pathology markers, and clinical symptoms.  
✔ Use **machine learning models** to enhance diagnostic precision and patient stratification.  
✔ Collaborate with **EBRAINS** to leverage high-performance computing and federated AI training.

## **🚀 Why is This Important?**  

Traditional CNS disease classification relies heavily on **phenotypic observations**, leading to:  
⚠ **Misdiagnoses** due to overlapping syndromes.  
⚠ **Delayed intervention** because of uncertainty in disease progression.  
⚠ **Limited precision medicine applications** due to lack of structured biomarker integration.  

Neurodiagnoses shifts the paradigm to a **data-driven approach**, using **AI-powered diagnostics** to provide **scalable, reliable, and precise solutions for CNS diseases**.
