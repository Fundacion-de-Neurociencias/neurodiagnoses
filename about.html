# What is Neurodiagnoses?  
Neurodiagnoses is an **AI-powered open-source diagnostic framework** designed to improve the accuracy of **complex central nervous system (CNS) disease diagnosis**.  

The project **integrates multi-modal data** (genetics, biomarkers, neuroimaging) with **machine learning models** to provide clinicians with a **dual diagnostic system**:

1️⃣ **Probabilistic Diagnosis** – AI assigns **multiple possible diagnoses** with probability percentages.  
2️⃣ **Tridimensional Diagnosis** – AI structures diagnoses based on:  
   - **Etiology** (genetic, metabolic, autoimmune, vascular, infectious)  
   - **Molecular Biomarkers** (CSF, PET, EEG, MRI markers)  
   - **Neuroanatomoclinical Correlations** (functional impairments, atrophy)  

For **every patient case, both systems will be provided**, allowing AI-assisted comparison of probability-based vs. structured classification.

## **Project Support & Collaboration**  
Neurodiagnoses is an **open-source initiative** promoted and supported by **[Fundación de Neurociencias](https://www.fneurociencias.org)**, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing neuroscience research and AI-driven diagnostics.

The project is developed in collaboration with:  
- **Fundación de Neurociencias** – Research, funding, and clinical validation.  
- **EBRAINS Collaboratory** – AI-powered computing and large-scale data storage.  
- **Open-Source AI & Neuroscience Community** – AI developers, researchers, and clinicians contributing to precision diagnostics.  

## **Project Objectives**  
✅ Develop an **AI-driven annotation system** to assist in CNS disease diagnosis.  
✅ Integrate **genetic, neuroimaging, and biomarker data** into a unified framework.  
✅ Implement a **tridimensional classification system** based on etiology, pathology markers, and clinical symptoms.  
✅ Use **machine learning models** to enhance diagnostic precision and patient stratification.  
✅ Collaborate with **EBRAINS** to leverage high-performance computing and federated AI training.  

## **Why is This Important?**  
Traditional CNS disease classification relies heavily on **phenotypic observations**, leading to:  
⚠ **Misdiagnoses** due to overlapping syndromes.  
⚠ **Delayed intervention** because of uncertainty in disease progression.  
⚠ **Limited precision medicine applications** due to lack of structured biomarker integration.  

Neurodiagnoses shifts the paradigm to a **data-driven approach**, using **AI-powered diagnostics** to provide **scalable, reliable, and precise solutions for CNS diseases**.

## **Key Components of the Project**  
🧠 **AI-Powered Annotation System** – Automates structured reporting based on biomarkers and neuroimaging data.  
📊 **EBRAINS Integration** – Stores and processes datasets for federated AI training.  
🔬 **Machine Learning Models** – Enhances predictive capabilities for disease progression.  
⚕️ **Clinical Decision Support** – Helps clinicians interpret diagnostic outputs with confidence.
