**ML pipelines for stratifying neurological biomarkers and predicting disease progression using multi-modal data from ADNI and PPMI cohorts.**

## Project Overview
This research initiative as part of a Master thesis with FundaciÃ³ de Neurosciences, develops non-invasive diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Our work focuses on:

1. **CSF Biomarker Stratification**  
   Predicting ABETA, pTau, and tTau positivity using:
   - MRI imaging features
   - Cognitive assessments
   - Demographic data
   - Genotypic markers  
   *(ADNI cohort)*

2. **Motor Score Prediction (UPDRS III)**
   Forecasting Parkinson's disease progression(UPDRS III motor scores) using:
   - DAT-SPECT imaging
   - MRI features
   - Genotypic data  
   *(PPMI cohort)*

4. **AD prediction with shallow ANNs**
   Exploring the masking by clinical data of other features predicting AD:
   - MRI imaging features
   - Cognitive assessments
   - Demographic data
   - Genotypic markers  
   *(ADNI cohort)*

## Key Features
- Multi-modal data integration (imaging + clinical + genetic)
- Biomarker ratio analysis for clinical trial triage
- Predictive modeling of disease progression

## Key Findings
Machine learning models trained on multimodal,non-invasive data can approximate CSF biomarker status and motor score symptom severity with clinically meaningful performance. Our tau positivity pipelines passed the minimum threshold AUC > 0.85 for application as a preliminary screening tool in clinical trial triage. In the PPMI pipelines, Integrating DAT-SPECT and genotypic features outperformed MRI only models and is close to clinical utility benchmark.
