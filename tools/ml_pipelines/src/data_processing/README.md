# Data Processing

This directory contains preprocessing pipelines for two major datasets used in the neurodiagnosis modeling tasks:

- **ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)**
- **PPMI (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative)**

Each subfolder includes scripts and notebooks to:
- Load and clean raw data
- Merge multi-modal sources (imaging, clinical scores, genotype, etc.)
- Handle missing values
- Engineer relevant features for modeling
- Output clean datasets ready for machine learning pipelines
