 How to Use External Databases in Neurodiagnoses
To enhance the accuracy of our diagnostic models, Neurodiagnoses integrates data from multiple biomedical and neurological research databases. If you are a researcher, follow these steps to access, prepare, and integrate data into the Neurodiagnoses framework.

1️⃣ Register for Access
Each database requires a separate registration and access approval. Follow the official access guidelines for each platform.

2️⃣ Download & Prepare Data
Once granted access, download datasets following the specific data usage terms. Ensure the files meet Neurodiagnoses' format requirements for integration.

Supported File Formats: .csv, .tsv, .nii (neuroimaging), .fasta (genetics)
Mandatory Fields for Integration: Subject ID, Diagnosis, Biomarkers, Genetic Data, Neuroimaging Metadata
3️⃣ Upload Data to Neurodiagnoses
Option 1: Manually upload to EBRAINS Bucket → [Collabs/neurodiagnoses/Bucket]
Option 2: Contribute via GitHub Repository → [GitHub: /data]
📌 Note: For large datasets, contact the project administrators before uploading.

4️⃣ Integrate with AI Models
Use Jupyter Notebooks on EBRAINS to preprocess and analyze data.
Run data harmonization scripts to standardize formats.
Train AI models with newly integrated patient cohorts.
