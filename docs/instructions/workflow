Neurodiagnoses Workflow: From Data to Diagnosis
1️⃣ Data Acquisition & Integration
🔹 Where? EBRAINS Bucket & GitHub Repository
🔹 What Happens?

Users (researchers/clinicians) access and download raw data from external sources (ADNI, GP2, PPMI, etc.).
Data is uploaded to EBRAINS Buckets or stored in GitHub (datasets/ directory).
Data is harmonized (genetics, neuroimaging, biomarkers) to ensure consistency.
🔹 Key Resources

🔗 EBRAINS Bucket
🔗 GitHub Datasets
📝 Instructions on Using External Databases (To be documented in docs/databases.md)
2️⃣ AI Model Training & Development
🔹 Where? EBRAINS Jupyter Lab & GitHub (models/ directory)
🔹 What Happens?

AI models are trained using machine learning & deep learning (Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.).
Feature extraction from MRI, EEG, and biomarkers.
Federated learning integration ensures privacy in multi-center collaborations.

🔗 EBRAINS Jupyter Notebooks
🔗 GitHub AI Models
📝 Model Documentation (To be added in docs/models.md)
3️⃣ Diagnostic Annotation System
🔹 Where? EBRAINS Lab & Neurodiagnoses Web Platform
🔹 What Happens?

AI generates two diagnostic reports per case:
1️⃣ Probabilistic Diagnosis (traditional classification with probabilities).
2️⃣ Tridimensional Diagnosis (classification based on etiology, biomarkers, and neuroanatomical correlation).
Results are annotated with SHAP interpretability tools.
🔹 Key Resources

📝 How AI Diagnosis Works (To be documented in docs/diagnosis.md)
4️⃣ Clinical Validation & User Interaction
🔹 Where? EBRAINS & Neurodiagnoses Collaborators
🔹 What Happens?

Clinicians & researchers test AI-generated diagnoses with real case studies.
Feedback loop refines model accuracy.
Collaboration with hospitals & AI research centers.
🔹 Key Resources

🔗 EBRAINS Collaboratory
📝 How to Contribute (Detailed in docs/contributing.md)
5️⃣ Continuous Improvement & Open Collaboration
🔹 Where? GitHub Repository & EBRAINS Discussion Pages
🔹 What Happens?

New data sources are integrated to improve models.
Contributors add new features, refine diagnostics, and publish findings.
Open-source community ensures transparency and long-term sustainability.
