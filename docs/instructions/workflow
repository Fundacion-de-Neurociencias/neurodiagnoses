Neurodiagnoses Workflow: From Data to Diagnosis
Neurodiagnoses integrates artificial intelligence with neuroscience to enhance diagnostics through structured workflows. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the entire pipeline, from data acquisition to continuous improvement.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Acquisition & Integration
Where?
EBRAINS Bucket & GitHub Repository

What Happens?
Researchers and clinicians obtain datasets from external sources (ADNI, GP2, PPMI, Enroll-HD, etc.).
Users download and upload data into EBRAINS Buckets or store it in GitHub datasets/ directory.
Data is harmonized, ensuring consistency across genetics, neuroimaging, and biomarkers.
Key Resources
EBRAINS Bucket for structured storage.
GitHub Datasets for dataset tracking and version control.
Instructions for Using External Databases (to be documented in docs/databases.md).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Where?
EBRAINS Jupyter Lab & GitHub (models/ directory)

What Happens?
Raw data is cleaned, normalized, and formatted for AI model training.
Standardization of neuroimaging scans, biomarkers, and genetic data.
Missing values are addressed via imputation techniques.
Feature extraction from MRI, EEG, and biomarker datasets.
Federated learning integration ensures privacy in multi-center collaborations.
Key Resources
EBRAINS Jupyter Notebooks for model training.
GitHub AI Models for structured pipeline development.
Model Documentation (to be added in docs/models.md).
3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Model Training & Development
Where?
EBRAINS Jupyter Notebooks & GitHub-hosted AI scripts

What Happens?
Machine learning models process structured data to detect patterns and classify CNS diseases.
Training is conducted using historical patient data, followed by evaluation on real-world cases.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are assessed.
Key Resources
GitHub AI Model Repository for storing trained models.
EBRAINS Collaboratory for computing power.
Evaluation Metrics Documentation (to be included in docs/training.md).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Diagnostic Annotation System
Where?
EBRAINS Lab & Neurodiagnoses Web Platform

What Happens?
AI generates two diagnostic reports per case: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Probabilistic Diagnosis: Traditional classification with probability scores.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Tridimensional Diagnosis: Classification based on etiology, biomarkers, and neuroanatomical correlation.
Results are annotated using SHAP interpretability tools.
AI models provide explanations for diagnoses to improve transparency.

Suggested clinical recommendations.
Reports are stored in EBRAINS Collaboratory for real-time access.
Key Resources
EBRAINS Report Storage for accessing structured diagnostics.
Report Format Documentation (to be created in docs/reports.md).
6Ô∏è‚É£ Clinical Validation & User Interaction
Where?
EBRAINS & Neurodiagnoses Collaborators

What Happens?
