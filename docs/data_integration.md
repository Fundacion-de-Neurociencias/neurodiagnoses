# Data Integration with the Medical Informatics Platform (MIP)

## Overview
Neurodiagnoses integrates clinical data via the EBRAINS Medical Informatics Platform (MIP). MIP federates decentralized clinical data, allowing Neurodiagnoses to securely access and process sensitive information for AI-based diagnostics.

## How It Works
1. **Authentication & API Access:**
   - Users must have an EBRAINS account.
   - Neurodiagnoses uses secure API endpoints to fetch clinical data (e.g., from the Federation for Dementia).

2. **Data Mapping & Harmonization:**
   - Retrieved data is normalized and converted to standard formats (.csv, .json).
   - Data from various sources is harmonized to ensure consistency for AI processing.

3. **Security & Compliance:**
   - All data access is logged and monitored.
   - Data remains on the MIP servers using federated learning techniques when possible.
   - Access is granted only after signing a Data Usage Agreement (DUA).

## Implementation Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your EBRAINS API credentials in `mip_integration.py`.
3. Run the script to download and harmonize clinical data.
4. Process the data for AI model training.
