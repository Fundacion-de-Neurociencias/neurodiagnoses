# Data Integration with the Medical Informatics Platform (MIP)

## Overview
Neurodiagnoses integrates clinical data via the **EBRAINS Medical Informatics Platform (MIP)**. MIP federates decentralized clinical data, allowing Neurodiagnoses to securely access and process sensitive information for AI-based diagnostics.

## How It Works
1. **Authentication & API Access:**
   - Users must have an **EBRAINS account**.
   - Neurodiagnoses uses **secure API endpoints** to fetch clinical data (e.g., from the **Federation for Dementia**).

2. **Data Mapping & Harmonization:**
   - Retrieved data is **normalized** and converted to standard formats (`.csv`, `.json`).
   - Data from **multiple sources** is harmonized to ensure consistency for AI processing.

3. **Security & Compliance:**
   - All data access is **logged and monitored**.
   - Data remains on **MIP servers** using **federated learning techniques** when possible.
   - Access is granted only after signing a **Data Usage Agreement (DUA)**.

## Implementation Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your **EBRAINS API credentials** in `mip_integration.py`.
3. Run the script to **download and harmonize clinical data**.
4. Process the data for **AI model training**.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the **[MIP Documentation](https://mip.ebrains.eu/)**.

# Data Processing & Integration with Clinica.Run

## Overview
Neurodiagnoses now supports **Clinica.Run**, an open-source neuroimaging platform designed for **multimodal data processing and reproducible neuroscience workflows**.

## How It Works
1. **Neuroimaging Preprocessing:**
   - MRI, PET, EEG data is preprocessed using **Clinica.Run pipelines**.
   - Supports **longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses**.

2. **Automated Biomarker Extraction:**
   - Standardized extraction of **volumetric, metabolic, and functional biomarkers**.
   - Integration with machine learning models in Neurodiagnoses.

3. **Data Security & Compliance:**
   - Clinica.Run operates in **compliance with GDPR and HIPAA**.
   - Neuroimaging data remains **within the original storage environment**.

## Implementation Steps
1. Install **Clinica.Run** dependencies.
2. Configure your **Clinica.Run pipeline** in `clinica_run_config.json`.
3. Run the pipeline for **preprocessing and biomarker extraction**.
4. Use processed neuroimaging data for **AI-driven diagnostics** in Neurodiagnoses.
