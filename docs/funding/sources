Funding Neurodiagnoses: Ensuring Sustainability for AI-Driven Diagnostics
Current Funding
At present, Neurodiagnoses is solely funded and supported by FundaciÃ³n de Neurociencias, a non-profit organization committed to advancing the fight against complex neurological disorders. While this initial funding enables the project to take shape, our resources are limited and do not cover long-term sustainability, large-scale clinical validation, or advanced computational needs.

Why Additional Funding is Needed?
To ensure the continuous development and real-world implementation of Neurodiagnoses, we seek additional funding to:

Expand AI research and development (e.g., new diagnostic models, federated learning).
Support large-scale clinical validation studies involving international collaborators.
Enhance computing infrastructure for more efficient data processing in EBRAINS.
Maintain an open-access ecosystem for clinicians, researchers, and AI developers.
How You Can Help?
We encourage researchers, organizations, and contributors to help us identify alternative funding sources. If you are aware of grants, research calls, institutional funding, or industry partnerships that could support Neurodiagnoses, we would love to hear from you.

ðŸ“Œ Ways to Contribute to Funding Initiatives
âœ… Suggest relevant funding opportunities (EU, NIH, national grants, private foundations).
âœ… Propose joint grant applications where Neurodiagnoses can fit as a key component.
âœ… Advocate for institutional support from universities, hospitals, and AI research groups.
âœ… Explore philanthropic or crowdfunding strategies to sustain long-term development.
