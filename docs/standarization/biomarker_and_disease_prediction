Integration of Multimodal Biomarker and Disease Prediction in Neurodiagnoses

Objective

This document outlines the integration of a machine learning-based approach to predict biomarker distributions and disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases within Neurodiagnoses. The goal is to improve diagnostics by leveraging plasma biomarkers, MRI-based features, and clinical assessments while reducing reliance on invasive or expensive imaging techniques.

1. Why Integrate This Model?

1.1 Advantages for Neurodiagnoses

Predicts Biomarker Load Non-Invasively: Uses plasma biomarkers (TDP-43, p-tau217, Aβ42/40, etc.) and MRI markers instead of expensive PET scans.

Identifies Asymmetry in Biomarker Distribution: Helps detect neurodegeneration subtypes based on regional biomarker accumulation.

Enhances Diagnostic Accuracy: Improves disease classification and progression tracking.

Generalizable to Different Cohorts: Adaptable across ADNI, UK Biobank, and hospital datasets.

Predicts Disease Progression: Uses ML-based probabilistic modeling to estimate the likelihood of MCI-to-AD conversion or other neurodegenerative disease transitions.
