# **Integration Proposal: Disease-Agnostic FDG-PET Hypometabolism Modeling in Neurodiagnoses**

## **1. Objective**
Integrate the methodological insights from the study *"Relationships between hypometabolism and both β-amyloid and tau PET in corticobasal syndrome"* into a **disease-agnostic framework** within Neurodiagnoses.com to:

- Enhance **probabilistic diagnostic modeling** across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.
- Generalize **FDG-PET-based hypometabolism mapping and asymmetry analysis**.
- Integrate biomarker-based stratification (e.g., A/T classification) into the diagnostic engine.

---

## **2. Summary of Core Methodological Concepts**
- Use of FDG-PET to map **regional cortical hypometabolism**.
- Stratification based on **amyloid (A) and tau (T) positivity** to predict disease subtype.
- Quantification of **asymmetry indices** between dominant and non-dominant hemispheres.
- Identification of **spatially distinct hypometabolic signatures** associated with biomarker-defined profiles.

## **3. Generalized Integration in Neurodiagnoses.com**

### **3.1 Probabilistic Annotation Layer**
- Train machine learning models on FDG-PET features with optional A/T biomarker stratification.
- Incorporate **asymmetry-aware metabolic profiles** into the probabilistic engine.
- Generate disease-agnostic likelihood estimates based on hypometabolism topology.

### **3.2 Tridimensional Annotation Framework**
- **Etiological axis**: represent genetic, environmental, and lifestyle-related risk factors.
- **Pathophysiological axis**: integrate multimodal biomarker signals (e.g., tau, amyloid, TDP-43, α-synuclein, vascular injury, glucose metabolism).
- **Anatomoclinical axis**: use hypometabolism distribution to inform symptom localization and subtype differentiation.

## **4. Generalized Workflow for Implementation**

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Preprocess FDG-PET and structural MRI.
   - Extract regional SUVR values and hemispheric asymmetry indices.
   - Harmonize PET data across scanners/cohorts (e.g., ADNI, OASIS-3, HCP-Aging).

2. **Model Development**
   - Train disease-agnostic models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, GNNs) on hypometabolism patterns.
   - Optionally stratify training using biomarker profiles (A+/T+, TDP+, vascular, metabolic).
   - Learn representations for overlapping and atypical neurodegenerative syndromes.

3. **Integration into Diagnostic Engine**
   - Add hypometabolism profile maps to patient annotation dashboard.
   - Support longitudinal comparison and phenotypic shift detection.
   - Enable probabilistic scoring for atypical or mixed presentations.

4. **Extension to Other Modalities**
   - Cross-reference hypometabolic regions with structural atrophy, tau PET, CSF and omics markers.
   - Build joint embedding models that combine imaging and molecular features.

## **5. Clinical and Research Benefits**
- Enables **non-disease-specific diagnostic modeling**.
- Supports identification of **biologically distinct subtypes** across and within diseases.
- Aids in recognizing **prodromal and overlapping phenotypes**.
- Facilitates **therapeutic stratification and clinical trial recruitment**.

---

## **6. Next Steps**
- Develop preprocessing pipeline for FDG-PET and asymmetry calculation.
- Validate classifiers on multi-disease datasets with known biomarker profiles.
- Extend annotation engine to include hypometabolism signatures.
- Publish exploratory disease-agnostic diagnostic cases using this framework.

**Conclusion:** By generalizing the spatial analysis of cortical metabolism and integrating it into a biomarker-aware probabilistic system, Neurodiagnoses.com can evolve into a truly disease-agnostic platform for precision diagnosis and multidimensional disease annotation in neurology.
