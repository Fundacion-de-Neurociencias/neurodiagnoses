Multi-Factorial Computational Models in Neurodiagnoses

1️⃣ Overview

This document outlines the workflow for integrating multi-factorial computational models into Neurodiagnoses.com, leveraging multi-modal data, probabilistic disease modeling, and AI-driven progression insights for neurodegenerative diseases.

2️⃣ Workflow Stages

Step 1: Multi-Modal Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

🔹 Data Sources: Neuroimaging (MRI, PET, dMRI), fluid biomarkers (CSF, blood, saliva), omics (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics).🔹 Standardization: Convert all data to BIDS-compliant formats using Clinica.run.🔹 Harmonization: Integrate cross-cohort datasets (ADNI, PPMI, UK Biobank, EBRAINS).🔹 Preprocessing Pipelines:

Neuroimaging: FreeSurfer, ANTs, fMRIPrep for volumetric and connectivity mapping.

Fluid Biomarkers: Normalize concentrations, perform outlier detection & imputation.

Omics: Batch correction, dimensionality reduction, gene set enrichment analysis.

Output: Cleaned, harmonized dataset ready for AI model training.

Step 2: Probabilistic Disease Progression Modeling

🔹 Event-Based Models (EBMs): Order disease-related biomarker changes along a probabilistic timeline.🔹 Disease Progression Models (DPMs): Predict individualized disease trajectories.🔹 Network Propagation Models: Simulate disease spread across brain connectivity networks.🔹 Machine Learning for Risk Stratification: Implement CNNs, Random Forest, XGBoost for disease staging.

Output: Probabilistic progression scores & biomarker event timelines for each patient.

Step 3: Multi-Omics & Network-Based Disease Annotation

🔹 Transcriptomic Vulnerability Mapping: Identify molecular pathways linked to brain atrophy regions.🔹 Neurochemical Susceptibility Analysis: Predict which neurochemical imbalances drive pathology.🔹 Multi-Omics Integration: Correlate omics with imaging-derived brain atrophy markers.
🔹 Structural & Functional Network Models: Simulate how neurodegeneration propagates over time.

Output: Individualized molecularly-informed disease subtypes based on imaging-omics interactions.

Step 4: AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support & Visualization

🔹 AI-Driven Disease Staging Dashboard:

Input: Patient neuroimaging, biomarker & omics data.

Output: Real-time probabilistic diagnosis & disease progression predictions.🔹 3D Visualization & Annotation:

Map biomarker abnormalities onto brain connectomes & voxel-wise regions.

Integrate tensor-based dMRI network metrics for disease propagation modeling.🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Enable AI-powered querying via PandasAI & vision-language models.

Example: “Show patients with early-stage neurodegeneration affecting limbic pathways.”

Output: Real-time AI-enhanced neurodiagnostic decision support for clinicians.
