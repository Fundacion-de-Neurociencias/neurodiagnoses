# Neurodiagnoses

## 📌 What is Neurodiagnoses?

Neurodiagnoses is an **AI-powered diagnostic framework** designed for **probabilistic modeling, multimodal data integration, and disease progression prediction** in **complex central nervous system (CNS) conditions**.

The project combines **machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, neuroimaging, biomarkers, and clinical assessments** to enhance diagnostic precision and enable **early-stage disease detection**.

## 🚀 Key Functionalities

* **Probabilistic Annotation** – AI-based diagnostic modeling using probabilistic networks.
* **Tridimensional Annotation** – Integration of neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data.
* **Multi-Model Advanced Annotation** – Unified pipeline for comprehensive 3-axis annotation using multiple AI models.
* **Interactive Visualization** – User-friendly interfaces for research and clinical applications.
* **Biomarker Prediction** – AI-driven estimation of biomarker status and progression.
* **Disease Prediction** – Modeling of disease onset, conversion, and progression using ML.

## 🧠 Axis Annotation Pipelines

Neurodiagnoses implements a **3-axis annotation system** to classify patients across:

* **Axis 1** – *Etiology / Causative factors*
* **Axis 2** – *Molecular features: Aβ, pTau, tTau*
* **Axis 3** – *Neuroanatomical-clinical (phenotypic) presentation*

You can run automatic annotation on sample patients using:

```bash
python -m tools.annotator.annotate --input data/sample_patient.json --output data/example_annotation.json
```

More examples:

* `data/sample_patient.json` → Axis 2
* `data/sample_patient_axis3.json` → Axis 3
* `data/sample_patient_full.json` → Combined axis annotation

Outputs are saved to corresponding `example_annotation_*.json` files.
Predictions use pre-trained models stored in `/models`.

## 🖼 Annotator UI

Use the interactive interface to explore annotation results:

* 📄 `annotator.html`: Web-based local viewer for patient JSON files and annotations.

Open in browser and load a JSON patient file to visualize axis-by-axis classification.

## 🚧 Legacy Advanced Multi-Modal Annotator (Deprecated)

This module was an earlier iteration of the advanced annotation framework. Its functionalities have been superseded by the new **Multi-Model Advanced Annotator**.

**Location:** `tools/advanced_annotator/`
**Components:**

* `data_ingestion/`: Parses clinical, imaging, and genetic sources into standardized JSON.
* `run_advanced_annotation.py`: Loads and flattens patient profiles into feature vectors.
* `train_model.py`: Trains advanced ML models (e.g., XGBoost) using multi-modal features.

This pipeline enabled thousands of features per patient and supported precision diagnostics at scale.

## ✨ Multi-Model Advanced Annotator

This new, unified pipeline integrates multiple AI models to generate a comprehensive 3-axis annotation for patient data. It combines genetic etiology prediction (Axis 1) with neuropathological phenotyping (Axis 3) to provide a coherent diagnostic output.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Axis 1 (Etiology) Prediction:** Utilizes a Deep Learning model (`tools/phenotype_to_genotype/model.py`) to predict the most probable genetic causes from a simulated list of HPO phenotypes.
2.  **Axis 3 (Neuropathology) Prediction:** Employs a data analysis pipeline (`tools/ml_pipelines/pipelines_axis3_pathology.py`) to generate a phenotypic description from real neuropathology data.
3.  **Axis 2 (Molecular Profile):** Currently a placeholder, awaiting full omics data integration.

**How to Run:**

To execute the multi-model advanced annotator and generate a full 3-axis annotation for a sample patient, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python -m tools.advanced_annotator.run_advanced_annotation
```

This will process the sample patient data (`patient_database/ND_001.json`) and output a structured annotation to the console.

**Example Output:**

```
--- FINAL MULTI-MODEL ANNOTATION ---
[YYYY-MM-DD]: Predicted Etiology (Probabilistic): [1. GEN_1: XX%], [2. GEN_2: YY%] / Molecular Profile (Requires Full Omics Data) / Neuropathology Profile (t-Tau): High burden in REGION_1 (score: X.XX), REGION_2 (score: Y.YY)
------------------------------------
```

This module represents a significant step towards comprehensive and automated neurodiagnostic assistance.
