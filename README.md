**Neurodiagnoses** is an AI-powered, open-source ecosystem designed to integrate multi-modal data and advanced computational models to enhance the diagnostic precision, risk assessment, and prognostic understanding of complex neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).

This project moves beyond traditional, static disease labels. It generates both a probabilistic differential for classical diagnoses and a rich, **tridimensional diagnostic annotation** that reflects the biological and clinical complexity of each patient, as described in its foundational paper: [Implementing a tridimensional diagnostic framework for personalized medicine in neurodegenerative diseases](https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14591).

## Ô∏è A Dual-System Architecture: Diagnosis & Prognosis

The Neurodiagnoses ecosystem combines two distinct but complementary computational systems: a "glass-box" Bayesian engine for deep diagnosis and "black-box" Machine Learning pipelines for prognosis and risk prediction.

### 1. The "Glass-Box" Bayesian Diagnostic Engine
This is the reasoning core of the system, responsible for generating the "Firma Neurodegenerativa" (Neurodegenerative Signature).

Function: Performs a diagnostic analysis to explain a patient's current state.

Methodology: It's a transparent, evidence-based system that uses a dynamic Knowledge Base and Bayesian inference to process patient data across our three fundamental axes (Etiology, Molecular Pathology, Phenotype).

Output: Produces the dual-output report containing the classical differential diagnosis and the rich, tridimensional annotation.

### 2. The "Black-Box" Machine Learning Prognostic Pipelines
Rescued and integrated from the project's rich development history, these pipelines are focused on prediction.

Function: Performs a prognostic analysis to predict future outcomes.

Methodology: Utilizes established Machine Learning models (e.g., Cox Proportional Hazards for survival analysis, Polygenic Hazard Scores) trained on large datasets to identify patterns and predict patient trajectories.

Output: Generates risk scores, predicts rates of progression, and estimates future clinical events.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started for Developers
This project is developed within GitHub Codespaces to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment.

1. Launch the Environment
Create a new codespace from the repository's main page on GitHub.

2. Install Dependencies
In the Codespace terminal, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch the Interactive UI
The main entry point to the ecosystem is the Gradio application.

```bash
python app.py
```
After running the command, navigate to the PORTS tab in your Codespace terminal, find the entry for port 7860, and click the globe icon (üåê) to open the application in your browser.
