# Neurodiagnoses: AI-Powered CNS Diagnosis Framework  

Neurodiagnoses is an **open-source AI diagnostic framework** for **complex central nervous system (CNS) disorders**.  
It integrates **multi-modal biomarkers, neuroimaging, and AI-based annotation** to improve precision diagnostics.

## 🔹 Two Diagnostic Approaches  

Neurodiagnoses offers two complementary AI-assisted diagnosis systems:  

### **1️⃣ Probabilistic Diagnosis (Traditional)**  
- Generates **multiple possible diagnoses**, each with a probability percentage.  
- Useful for **differential diagnosis and ranking possible conditions.**  
- Example Output:  
80% Prion Disease
15% Autoimmune Encephalitis
5% Alzheimer's Disease

### **2️⃣ Tridimensional Diagnosis (Structured)**  
- Diagnoses are based on:  
- **Axis 1: Etiology** (genetic, autoimmune, prion, vascular, toxic)  
- **Axis 2: Molecular Markers** (biomarkers, EEG, neuroinflammation)  
- **Axis 3: Neuroanatomoclinical Correlations** (MRI atrophy, PET, functional impairment)  
- This approach enhances **precision medicine and biomarker-guided diagnosis.**  

🔹 **For every patient case, both systems will be provided, allowing AI-assisted comparison of probability-based vs. structured classification.**
