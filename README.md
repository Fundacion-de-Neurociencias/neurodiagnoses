# Neurodiagnostics

Neurodiagnostics is an open-source project developing a 3D diagnostic framework for complex central nervous system (CNS) diseases using artificial intelligence (AI). This project is driven by the Fundaci√≥n de Neurociencias, and is powered by EBRAINS, GitHub, Hugging Face, and the community.

## Goals

* Develop a precise and scalable diagnostic system for CNS diseases.
* Integrate multimodal data (neuroimaging, biomarkers, ontologies).
* Utilize digital twins of the CNS to simulate disease progression.
* Provide structured and explainable diagnoses.

## Key Features

* **Tridimensional Diagnostic Annotation:** Structures diagnoses based on etiology (mainly genetics), molecular biomarkers, and neuroanatomical correlations.
* **Probabilistic Diagnostics:** Provides multiple possible diagnoses with associated probability percentages.
* **CNS Digital Twin Integration:** Incorporates personalized digital replicas of a patient's CNS.
* **AI-powered Annotation:** Enhances standardization and interpretability of diagnostic features.
* **Open-source platform:** Encourages collaboration and community contributions.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow/PyTorch
* NiBabel, Nilearn (Neuroimaging libraries)
* EBRAINS
* Hugging Face
* GitHub

## Installation and Setup

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Fundacion-de-Neurociencias/neurodiagnoses.git`
2.  Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
3.  Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Provide the content of requirements.txt below)
5.  Configure EBRAINS credentials as required.

## Usage and Examples

To run the main diagnostic script:

```bash
python neurodiagnostics/main.py --input_data path/to/data --model_type 3d

Replace path/to/data with the actual path to your input data, and --model_type with either 3d or probabilistic.
