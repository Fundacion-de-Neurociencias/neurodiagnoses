# Neurodiagnoses

 **What is Neurodiagnoses?**

Neurodiagnoses is an AI-powered diagnostic framework designed for probabilistic modeling, multimodal data integration, and disease progression prediction in complex central nervous system (CNS) conditions.
The project combines machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, neuroimaging, biomarkers, and clinical assessments to enhance diagnostic precision and enable early-stage disease detection.

### Core Architecture (`src/`)

The project is being refactored into a professional Python package structure under `src/`. This ensures modularity, testability, and scalability. The key modules are:

- **`src/neurodiagnoses/ontology/`**: Defines the core data structures and controlled vocabularies (e.g., Neuromarker).
- **`src/neurodiagnoses/processing/`**: Contains modules for data ingestion, cleaning, and feature extraction from raw sources.
- **`src/neurodiagnoses/models/`**: Will contain the implementations of the core AI models (e.g., Transformer, GNNs) that operate on the standardized data.
