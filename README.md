# Neurodiagnoses  

## 📌 What is Neurodiagnoses?  
Neurodiagnoses is an **AI-powered diagnostic framework** designed for **probabilistic modeling, multimodal data integration, and disease progression prediction** in **complex central nervous system (CNS) conditions**.  

The project combines **machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, neuroimaging, biomarkers, and clinical assessments** to enhance diagnostic precision and enable **early-stage disease detection**.  

## 🚀 Key Functionalities  
- **Probabilistic Annotation** – AI-based diagnostic modeling using probabilistic networks.  
- **Tridimensional Annotation** – Integration of neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data.  
- **Interactive Visualization** – User-friendly interfaces for research and clinical applications.  
- **Biomarker Prediction** – AI-driven estimation of biomarker status and progression.  
- **Disease Prediction** – Modeling of disease onset, conversion, and progression using ML.
