# Neurodiagnoses

📌 **What is Neurodiagnoses?**

Neurodiagnoses is an AI-powered diagnostic framework designed for probabilistic modeling, multimodal data integration, and disease progression prediction in complex central nervous system (CNS) conditions.
The project combines machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, neuroimaging, biomarkers, and clinical assessments to enhance diagnostic precision and enable early-stage disease detection.

### Core Architecture (`src/`)

The project is being refactored into a professional Python package structure under `src/`. This ensures modularity, testability, and scalability. The key modules are:

- **`src/neurodiagnoses/ontology/`**: Defines the core data structures and controlled vocabularies (e.g., Neuromarker).
- **`src/neurodiagnoses/processing/`**: Contains modules for data ingestion, cleaning, and feature extraction from raw sources.
- **`src/neurodiagnoses/models/`**: Will contain the implementations of the core AI models (e.g., Transformer, GNNs) that operate on the standardized data.

🚀 **Key Functionalities**

- **Probabilistic Annotation** – AI-based diagnostic modeling using probabilistic networks.
- **Tridimensional Annotation** – Integration of neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data.
- **Multi-Model Advanced Annotation** – Unified pipeline for comprehensive 3-axis annotation using multiple AI models.
- **Interactive Visualization** – User-friendly interfaces for research and clinical applications.
- **Biomarker Prediction** – AI-driven estimation of biomarker status and progression.
- **Disease Prediction** – Modeling of disease onset, conversion, and progression using ML.

�� **Axis Annotation Pipelines**

Neurodiagnoses implements a 3-axis annotation system to classify patients across:
- **Axis 1** – Etiology / Causative factors
- **Axis 2** – Molecular features: Aβ, pTau, tTau
- **Axis 3** – Neuroanatomical-clinical (phenotypic) presentation

You can run automatic annotation on sample patients using: `python -m tools.annotator.annotate --input data/sample_patient.json --output data/example_annotation.json`

🖼️ **Annotator UI**

Use the interactive interface to explore annotation results:
- 📄 **annotator.html**: Web-based local viewer for patient JSON files and annotations.

✨ **Multi-Model Advanced Annotator**

This new, unified pipeline integrates multiple AI models to generate a comprehensive 3-axis annotation for patient data. It combines genetic etiology prediction (Axis 1) with neuropathological phenotyping (Axis 3) to provide a coherent diagnostic output.

🚀 **Current Achievements:**
- ✅ Developed a biomarker-agnostic machine learning model using `RandomForestClassifier`.
- ✅ Trained the model on simulated data and saved it as `model.pkl`.
- ✅ Uploaded the trained model to Hugging Face: Neurodiagnoses Hugging Face Repo
- ✅ Created an API using FastAPI and Uvicorn for real-time predictions.
- ✅ Successfully tested the API locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
