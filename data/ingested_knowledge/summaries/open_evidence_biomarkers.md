Current data indicate that blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases show moderate to high diagnostic and prognostic performance, particularly for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a large prospective cohort (MEMENTO, n=2,277), blood phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) was the best single blood biomarker for identifying amyloid-PET positivity (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.69–0.79) and predicting 5-year risk of AD/mixed dementia (c-index = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.69–0.77). The predictive accuracy increased in patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 (c-index = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69–0.97) compared to those with CDR = 0.5 (c-index = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.66–0.74). Adding blood p-tau181 and Aβ42/40 to clinical models improved the c-index from 0.88 to 0.90, and to 0.92 when combined with APOE genotype and MRI features.[1]
A systematic review and meta-analysis found that p-tau181 and p-tau217 achieved excellent discriminative accuracy (AUC >0.9) for differentiating AD from frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). For AD vs. dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), only certain microRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-451a) reached AUC >0.9, while other protein biomarkers generally showed good accuracy (AUC 0.8–0.9).[2]
Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a sensitive but non-specific marker of neurodegeneration, with higher levels correlating with cognitive decline in both AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD). In a recent cohort, NfL levels <20 ng/L with elevated p-tau181 were indicative of AD, while NfL <40 ng/L suggested PD. Combining GFAP, NfL, and p-tau181 improved differential diagnosis between AD, PD, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).[3]
Gene expression-based blood biomarker panels using machine learning achieved ROC-AUCs of 0.886 for AD and 0.743 for PD, supporting their potential for early diagnosis.[4]
In summary, p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP are the most validated blood biomarkers, with p-tau species showing the highest specificity for AD, and NfL providing sensitive but less specific detection of neurodegeneration across disorders. Combining multiple biomarkers further improves diagnostic accuracy.[1-4]
