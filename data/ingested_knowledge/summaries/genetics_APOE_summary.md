APOE is the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The odds ratio (OR) for developing AD is substantially increased in carriers of the ε4 allele. A landmark meta-analysis (Farrer et al., 1997, JAMA) established clear risk profiles based on genotype in Caucasian populations. For individuals with one copy of the ε4 allele (genotype ε3/ε4), the odds ratio for AD is approximately 3.2 (95% CI: 2.8–3.8). For homozygous carriers with two copies (genotype ε4/ε4), the odds ratio skyrockets to 14.9 (95% CI: 10.8–20.6). Conversely, the ε2 allele is considered protective, with an odds ratio of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.5–0.8) for carriers.
