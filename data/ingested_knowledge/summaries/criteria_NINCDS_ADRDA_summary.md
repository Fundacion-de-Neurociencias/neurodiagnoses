The 1984 NINCDS-ADRDA criteria are a cornerstone for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large meta-analysis assessing their diagnostic accuracy against neuropathological confirmation found a pooled sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75–0.86) and a pooled specificity of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.65–0.74) for probable AD. The accuracy is moderate, reflecting the difficulty of clinical diagnosis without biomarker evidence. For possible AD, the sensitivity increases to 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87-0.96) but specificity drops significantly to 0.55 (95% CI: 0.49-0.61).
