User is strictly prohibited from generating or using images or comparable representations of the face, head, or body for facial recognition, re-identification, or other purposes that could allow the identities of research participants to be readily ascertained.
User will not use or further disclose the OASIS-3 or OASIS-4 other than as permitted by this agreement or as otherwise required by law. Additionally, User will not use or further disclose any derivative works or derivative data of the OASIS datasets, in any case in whole or in part, that could be used to reconstruct a facial image.
