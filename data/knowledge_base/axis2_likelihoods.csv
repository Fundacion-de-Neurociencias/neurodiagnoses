p-tau181,auc,0.74,0.69,0.79,2277,Alzheimer's Disease,"MEMENTO, a large prospective cohort","In a large prospective cohort (MEMENTO, n=2,277), blood phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) was the best single blood biomarker for identifying amyloid-PET positivity (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.69–0.79) and predicting 5-year risk of AD/mixed dementia (c-index = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.69–0.77)."
p-tau181,c-index,0.83,0.69,0.97,,Alzheimer's Disease,patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0,"The predictive accuracy increased in patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 (c-index = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69–0.97) compared to those with CDR = 0.5 (c-index = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.66–0.74)."
Gene expression-based blood biomarker panels,auc,0.886,,,,Alzheimer's Disease,AD,"Gene expression-based blood biomarker panels using machine learning achieved ROC-AUCs of 0.886 for AD and 0.743 for PD, supporting their potential for early diagnosis."
NfL,auc,0.743,,,,Parkinson’s Disease,PD,"Gene expression-based blood biomarker panels using machine learning achieved ROC-AUCs of 0.886 for AD and 0.743 for PD, supporting their potential for early diagnosis."
