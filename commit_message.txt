docs: Refactor README.md for Open Core model and update Bayesian Engine logic

Refactor README.md:
- Removed obsolete "Multi-Disease XAI Pipeline and Clinical Dashboard" section.
- Updated "Scientific Foundation & Core Architecture" to remove specific code file references.
- Aligned public documentation with the "Open Core" model.

feat: Implement Specificity Logic v3.0 in Bayesian Engine:
- Modified `_get_dist_params` in `tools/bayesian_engine/core.py` to incorporate new specificity logic.
- Evidence now applies directly to specific disease hypotheses or defaults to neutral values if not specific.
