# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to this repository! To ensure consistency and best practices across the team, please follow these conventions when working with notebooks and scripts.

## ðŸ“’ When to Use Notebooks (Jupyter, Colab)

Use notebooks in the following cases:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial inspection of datasets, missing values, distributions, correlations.
- **Visualization and Communication**: Interactive plots, tables, summaries for discussion with clinical or non-technical stakeholders.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Testing models quickly (e.g., `sklearn`, XGBoost) without production-ready code.
- **Visual Documentation**: Show reasoning behind hypotheses and initial decisions.

**Notebook Best Practices:**
- Start each notebook with a clear title, dataset description, and version.
- Clear outputs before committing to the repo.
- Save notebooks under: `/notebooks`

## ðŸ§± When to Use Scripts and Modular Code

Use structured Python scripts when:

- Code is **reusable**, **scheduled**, or part of a **pipeline**.
- You're training, saving, or evaluating models for **production**.
- You need version control, reproducibility, or integration (e.g., via API).
- You're automating repeated tasks (e.g., MRI preprocessing, biomarker extraction).

**Recommended structure:**

```
/src
  â”œâ”€â”€ data/
  â”œâ”€â”€ features/
  â”œâ”€â”€ models/
  â”œâ”€â”€ pipelines/
  â””â”€â”€ utils/
```

Use tools like `MLflow`, `DVC`, or `W&B` to track experiments.

## ðŸ”„ Combining Both Approaches

- Notebooks may **call functions** from `/src/` to visualize outputs interactively.
- Use **notebooks to explore and communicate**, and **scripts to formalize and maintain**.
